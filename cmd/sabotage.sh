# Score the two cmd tools' tests by sabotage rather than by asserting they are good.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. internal/textutil/sabotage.sh ends with a section headed
# "known gaps, reported rather than hidden", and that section says:
#
#     cmd/seed and cmd/migrate-inber call sites: NOT SCORED. Both are package
#     main with no test files, so reverting either call site to the byte cut
#     reddens nothing.
#
# That was true when it was written. This script is what closes it, so the two
# scripts have to be read together: that one scores the helper, this one scores
# the callers, and the sentence above has been struck there.
#
# HOW TO READ THE VERDICT COLUMN. This table scores MECHANISMS: each row reverts
# one piece of the fix and asks whether the suite notices.
#
#     CAUGHT    == good. The suite detects that mechanism's absence.
#     UNNOTICED == a hole, EXCEPT on a row whose expectation IS UNNOTICED, where
#                  it is required and where the row exists to prove the scorer
#                  can still return a negative.
#
# A VOID row is neither: the mutation did not apply, did not change anything, or
# did not compile. VOID is counted as not-ok, never as coverage.
#
# ⚠️ BUILD FAILURE IS NOT COVERAGE, and this is the one thing this script does
# that its sibling does not. `go test` exits non-zero when the package does not
# compile, which looks exactly like a test failing. Reverting a call site to the
# byte cut leaves textutil imported and unused, so the naive mutation does not
# fail the tests -- it fails the compiler, and a classifier that cannot tell the
# two apart scores a clean sheet while asserting nothing. Every mutation below
# that would orphan an import keeps it alive with a `_ =` line, and the
# classifier returns VOID on a build error rather than CAUGHT.
#
# Every mutation is an EXACT string replacement, not a regex, and the replacement
# asserts its search string was present and unique. A regex that goes stale
# silently mutates nothing and scores a bogus UNNOTICED.
#
# Run from anywhere. Requires a clean tree: each case restores with
# `git checkout --`, which on an uncommitted tree discards your work rather than
# the mutation.
