"""Score agent-store's tests for the tracked-file enable switch by breaking it.

The scoring engine — and the rules it enforces as refusals — lives in
scripts/sabotage.py. This file is only the case list: one edit per mechanism
the suite is meant to pin.

    python3 scripts/sabotage-tracked-file-enabled.py [--diffs] [--crosstable]

⚠️ **This is the engine's THIRD copy, and it is the same blob as the other two.**
md5 `9a81a32e5827b59c1a3093bf88187b17`, taken from git blob
`664f35f475edb9b7d018a28136211bf58a0ff53e`, which is what both
`scheduler/fix/the-scorer-counts-occurrences-not-files` and
`bundle-store/docs/one-sabotage-engine-again` carry after the 219th pass
re-unified them. Diff before editing; a fourth blob is a fork.

⚠️ And a measurement trap worth one line, because it nearly cost this pass a
false finding: the working checkouts of scheduler and bundle-store are on OTHER
branches, so `md5sum` over their working trees answers with two different old
blobs and reads exactly like the 219th's unification never happened. Compare the
BLOBS on the branches that carry the work, not the files in the checkout.

Why this seam is worth a scorer: `SetTrackedFileEnabled` is the only store
method on this box whose effect is a **rename on disk** as well as a row update,
and until the 221st pass nothing executed it — a panic() on its first line left
`go test ./...` green. Two effects is the whole point. Every other enable switch
here writes one row, so reading the row back proves the write happened; this one
can move the file without writing the row, or write the row without moving the
file, and the HTTP reply reports only the row. The cases below therefore split
"moved the file" from "wrote the row" rather than scoring them together.

TWO targets, deliberately. The flag is written in files.go and routed in
server.go by a one-line pair of handlers differing only by the bool they
forward. A scorer covering only files.go would put a number on the half of the
feature that cannot lose a verb to a copy-paste.

Case-writing rules inherited from the scheduler and bundle-store plans:

  - Prefer a DRIFTED VALUE to a deletion. It orphans no variable, needs no
    second edit, and is the likelier real-world regression.
  - A control is a case and obeys the case rules (220th). Both controls below
    were checked against them before the first full run.
  - Read every applied diff against its label (`--diffs`). A row prints the name
    you gave it, not the edit you made.
  - An UNNOTICED row is a claim about which LINE the engine moved before it is a
    claim about the tests (218th).

Score when filed by the 221st pass: 12/12 real mechanisms caught, both controls
behaved, exit 0.

⚠️ Region this plan does NOT cover, declared rather than left to be
rediscovered. Every case below edits the enable switch, `DiskPath`, and the two
routes that drive it. `Scan`, `upsertTrackedFile`, `WriteTrackedFileVersioned`,
`captureExistingIfNew`, the version log and every other route are NOT sabotaged
here — except where `TestAScanAgreesWithTheSuffixTheSwitchWrites` reaches Scan
on purpose, to pin the suffix as a contract between the two. That is the seam
the 221st pass opened and nothing more; it is not a statement that the rest is
covered.

⚠️ `--crosstable` has NOT been taken for this repo and no `unreddened`
declaration is made below, because an empty one would read as "measured and
found none" rather than "not measured". The next pass on this repo owns that.

📄 One case is missing on purpose. `SetTrackedFileEnabled` renames BEFORE it
updates the row, so a failing UPDATE leaves the file moved and the row stale,
and the caller is told the whole thing failed. There is no seam to inject a DB
failure through without a fake store, so the ordering is unscored rather than
silently claimed. It is the sharpest remaining hole in this function after the
clobber characterised in files_enabled_test.go.
