# Score this package's tests by sabotage rather than by asserting they are good.
#
# HOW TO READ THE VERDICT COLUMN. This table scores MECHANISMS: each row reverts
# one piece of the fix and asks whether the suite notices. So here:
#
#     CAUGHT    == good. The suite detects that mechanism's absence.
#     UNNOTICED == a hole, EXCEPT on a row whose expectation IS UNNOTICED, where
#                  it is required and where the row exists to prove the scorer
#                  can still return a negative.
#
# That is the opposite of a table scoring ASSERTIONS by deletion, where UNNOTICED
# means the assertion was the sole detector. Stated here because a verdict column
# meaning the reverse of a neighbouring table's is one a reader misreads exactly
# once. This table scores mechanisms. Deleting an assertion on a healthy tree can
# never redden anything, so that move is not used below.
#
# CAUGHT is split further. A red that comes from the fixture guard
# ("fixture is wrong: ...") is NOT coverage of the mechanism -- it means the
# mutation broke the test's own setup before reaching the thing under test. A
# panic IS coverage when its top in-repo frame is non-test source, because a
# mutated bounds guard can only ever signal by panicking; it is not coverage when
# the panic is in the fixture. Filter panic frames by FULL PATH: runtime/panic.go
# ends in .go, is not _test.go, and a filename-only filter would invert the rule.
#
# Every mutation is an EXACT string replacement, not a regex. A regex that goes
# stale silently mutates nothing and scores a bogus UNNOTICED; the VOID row below
# exists because that happened while this script was being written. The
# replacement asserts its search string was present and unique.
#
# Run from anywhere. Requires a clean tree: each case restores with
# `git checkout --`, which would silently discard uncommitted work instead of the
# mutation and leave a clean tree doing it.
